# Method

## Method part 1

\blindtext The end result is in @fig-logo.

![JOAS Logo](extra/joas-logo.pdf){#fig-logo width=60% fig-align="center"}

\blindtext

Some text with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is how a footnote works.



## Method part 2

### Method part 2-1

\blindtext Reference to Equation @eq-cauchy_momentum.

$$
\rho\frac{\mathrm{D} \mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{D} t} = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
$$ {#eq-cauchy_momentum}




### Method part 2-2

\blindtext Table @tbl-example-table shows an example.

| Parameter   | Notation  | Remarks                  |
|:------------|:----------|:-------------------------|
| name        | -         | engine common identifier |
| manufacture | -         | name of the manufacture  |
| bpr         | $\lambda$ | bypass ratio             |
| pr          | -         | pressure ratio           |
| thrust      | $T_0$     | maximum static thrust.   |
